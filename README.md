2. Gather Data
Sources: Use APIs like Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, or Quandl to get historical stock price data.
Data Range: Decide on the time range for your data. Longer historical data might help the model understand long-term trends.

3. Preprocess the Data
Cleaning: Handle missing values, outliers, and anomalies.
Normalization: Stock price data should be normalized for better performance of neural networks.
Feature Engineering: Create features like moving averages, Relative Strength Index (RSI), etc., which might help in capturing trends.

4. Choose an AI Model
Time Series Models: LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) networks are popular for time series prediction. Other options include ARIMA, GARCH, or more complex neural networks like Transformers.
Machine Learning Models: Regression models, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc.

5. Train the Model
Split the Data: Divide your data into training, validation, and test sets.
Training: Use the training set to train your model.
Validation: Use the validation set to fine-tune hyperparameters and avoid overfitting.

6. Evaluate the Model
Metrics: Use metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), or others suitable for regression problems.
Backtesting: Simulate how the model would perform on historical data.

7. Implementation
Real-Time Data: For real-world application, you need to integrate real-time data feeds.
Automation: Automate the process of data fetching, prediction, and potentially trading (if that's an end goal).

Libraries: Pandas for data manipulation, NumPy for numerical operations, Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization, scikit-learn for basic ML models, TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch for neural networks.
