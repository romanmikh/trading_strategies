# Simple Moving Average Crossover Strategy

This code implements the well known simple moving average (SMA) trading strategy. Buy and sell signals are generated when rolling averages of two different periods cross, indicating that the stock is outperforming/underperforming its longer term moving average.

Ongoing work on this strategy includes backtesting it and comparing the effectiveness of various rolling average periods, to test the hypothesis set forth by ETF HQ in their study: http://etfhq.com/blog/2013/01/15/golden-cross-which-is-the-best/#Top.
